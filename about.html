                <span>Hi, I'm Jared!<br><br>
                After several years in a management position for an insurance carrier, I had my first exposure to programming, and began to realize that I'd "missed my calling".  I decided to pursue my newfound passion by completing the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Thinkful.<br><br>
                Problem solving is what I live for, and there’s never a lack of those opportunities when it comes to programming!  After all, if I can consolidate the number of manual steps a user has to take to accomplish a task, why not make their life a little easier?<br><br>
                In my personal life, I’m an excellent cook, love to travel, and I enjoy singing (I’m told I’m pretty good at it).<br><br>
                ...Oh, did I mention I love problem solving?<br><br>
